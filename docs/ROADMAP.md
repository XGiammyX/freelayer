# FreeLayer Roadmap

> [!NOTE]
> No dates, deliberately: phases ship when their exit criteria are met, and gates — not schedules — decide when implementation may start. ✅ marks verified-done work only.

## Purpose

Sequence the work from empty repository to alpha release, with explicit gates: research before design, design before implementation, tests and audit before trust.

## Current status

**Phase 0.5 — Architecture Decision Lock — in progress** (Phase 0 deliverables complete, including the license decision — [ADR-0011](adr/ADR-0011-license-strategy.md)). No dates are attached to phases; this is a small-team open-source project and honesty beats fake schedules. Phases ship when their exit criteria are met.

---

### Phase 0 — Research and repository foundation

Repository structure, documentation set, contribution/security policy, CI baseline.

- Exit criteria: this documentation set exists and is internally consistent; license finalized; CI green on the empty monorepo.
- ✅ License decision complete: code AGPL-3.0-or-later, documentation CC BY-SA 4.0 ([ADR-0011](adr/ADR-0011-license-strategy.md), [LICENSE-DOCS.md](LICENSE-DOCS.md)).
- Remaining: maintainer team setup, first external design feedback.

### Phase 0.5 — Architecture Decision Lock *(current)*

Turn the documentation into a binding project constitution before any implementation: ADRs, policy conflict rule, storage write barrier, hostile-input parsing rules, AI implementation gate, documentation coupling, implementation gates.

- Exit criteria:
  - ✅ ADR directory exists ([docs/adr/](adr/)) with ADR-0001…ADR-0011 accepted.
  - ✅ License strategy finalized ([ADR-0011](adr/ADR-0011-license-strategy.md)).
  - ✅ [SOVEREIGN_ROOMS.md](SOVEREIGN_ROOMS.md) is complete enough for design review.
  - ✅ Policy conflict rule exists ([PRIVACY_MODEL.md](PRIVACY_MODEL.md)).
  - ✅ Write barrier rule exists ([STORAGE_MODEL.md](STORAGE_MODEL.md)).
  - ✅ Network side-effect barrier exists ([NETWORK_MODEL.md](NETWORK_MODEL.md)).
  - ✅ Capsule hostile-input parsing rule exists ([CAPSULENET.md](CAPSULENET.md)).
  - ✅ AI implementation gate exists ([LOCAL_AI.md](LOCAL_AI.md)).
  - ✅ Documentation coupling rule exists ([CONTRIBUTING_SECURITY.md](CONTRIBUTING_SECURITY.md)).
  - ✅ Security review checklist exists ([SECURITY_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md](SECURITY_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md)).
  - ✅ Implementation gates exist ([IMPLEMENTATION_GATES.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GATES.md), Gates A–J).
  - ✅ Trust Center updated to mention this phase ([TRUST_CENTER.md](TRUST_CENTER.md)).
  - ✅ No contradictions remain in hard constraints (verified this pass; re-verified at every phase boundary).
- Remaining: external design review of the locked decisions.

### Phase 1 — Monorepo and app shells *(started — Prompt 03)*

Workspace packages with real builds; `apps/web` (React+Vite) and `apps/desktop` (Tauri) shells that render, with strict CSP and zero external assets from day one; lint rules enforcing dependency direction.

Progress (Prompt 03):

- ✅ Monorepo: 12 typed packages + 4 apps; `pnpm typecheck/lint/test/build` run real work and pass.
- ✅ Web shell: local-only React+Vite status page, strict CSP, zero external assets, builds for production.
- ✅ Mechanical guardrails (baseline): import-boundary check (dependency direction), no-external-assets check, no-telemetry check, forbidden-storage check — all wired into CI and `audit:privacy`.
- ✅ Side-effect scaffolding: storage/transport placeholders require a `PolicyDecision` and fail closed; baseline tests verify it.
- ⬜ Desktop: placeholder only — Tauri shell still to come (kept minimal deliberately; permissions surface deferred).
- ✅ ESLint-based enforcement added (flat config + typescript-eslint): AST-backed `no-restricted-globals`/`no-restricted-imports` over shipped source, upgrading the static-scan baseline (which remains as belt-and-suspenders). See [PLATFORM_STATE_ANALYSIS.md](PLATFORM_STATE_ANALYSIS.md).
- ✅ First real CI run on GitHub — green on `main` and PRs since INFRA-01 ([LIVE_CI_REPORT.md](LIVE_CI_REPORT.md)).

- Exit: `pnpm build/typecheck/lint/test` run real work; shells launch; privacy-regression workflow checks real artifacts. **Not complete yet** — desktop shell and hosted CI verification remain.

### Phase 2 — Policy engines

`packages/privacy` (Privacy Modes as versioned policy schema) and `packages/storage` (policy-selected backends: encrypted-persistent placeholder, memory-only, null). Core operation pipeline: validate → policy check → execute.

- Exit: modes switch real behavior in a demo harness; "Ghost writes nothing" is a passing test; AIPolicy hooks reserved.

### Phase 3 — Identity Firewall

Local identities, ephemeral identities, per-contact/per-room aliases, invite/verification design (QR + short-code, PAKE-inspired), device keys design, recovery kit design. Crypto library evaluation concludes here (gate for Phase 4).

- Exit: identity model documented and reviewed; no server anywhere in the design; recovery trade-offs documented bluntly.

### Phase 4 — CapsuleNet MVP

Capsule envelope format (`packages/protocol`), seal/unseal via reviewed crypto facade, Capsule Inbox with quarantine, spool, first transports: file export/import + QR (offline-first before networked), then the reference relay + relay transport.

- Exit: two devices exchange capsules via file AND via relay; replay/dedup handled; test vectors published.

### Phase 5 — Messaging MVP

1:1 messaging over capsules: session protocol profile (forward-secrecy question resolved per CRYPTO_DESIGN.md), contact exchange, delivery acks as end-to-end capsules.

- Exit: usable 1:1 chat across at least two transports; external crypto review engaged (gate for any release).

### Phase 6 — Sovereign Rooms research and MVP

Room object model, operation log + merge rules, membership and key rotation design, room bundles. CRDT evaluation memo decides the document story.

- Exit: multi-member room converges under out-of-order delivery; decision ledger prototype.

### Phase 7 — Storage and documents

Encryption-at-rest with crypto-shredding key hierarchy, document/file objects with chunked blob handling, cache policy enforcement, emergency wipe, Vault Inspector.

- Exit: at-rest story reviewed; wipe semantics documented honestly per platform.

### Phase 8 — Local AI research and MVP

Runtime evaluation, model adapter interface, AI Privacy Guard, first feature (room summaries) — local-only, opt-in, provenance-labeled.

- Exit: AI respects modes/AIPolicy provably (tests); prompt-injection annex in threat model; zero network calls verified.

### Phase 9 — Desktop/PWA hardening

Tauri capability lockdown, CSP audit, PWA storage/eviction honesty pass, OS keychain integration, notification privacy.

- Exit: hardening checklist published in TRUST_CENTER.md with pass/fail per platform.

### Phase 10 — Security automation

Full privacy-regression suite (wire + disk assertions), security-regression suite, fuzzing of protocol parsers, SBOM generation, dependency policy automation, PBOM auto-diff.

- Exit: the guarantees documented in PRIVACY_MODEL.md that are machine-checkable are machine-checked in CI.

### Phase 11 — Alpha release

Signed builds, reproducibility investigation, release process, known-limitations sheet, coordinated external review of release candidate.

- Exit: an honest alpha: clearly labeled experimental, with TRUST_CENTER.md accurately describing what has and has not been verified.

## Work categories

Roadmap items fall into four categories; the technical phase numbering above is unchanged by the others:

- **TECH** — product/engineering phases (the numbered phases above; e.g. TECH-05 Storage Policy + Write Barrier Hardening)
- **INFRA** — repository/CI/publication work
- **RESEARCH** — research and architecture passes that precede implementation
- **AUDIT** — regression suites, audits, verification passes

## Task tracks (prompt-level roadmap)

- ✅ TECH-17 RoomOS Local Operation Log + Projection Regression Suite — exit criteria met (stacked on TECH-16): log-grade `RoomOperationEventV1` (schemaVersion/projectionVersion 1, branded `RoomEventId`/`RoomLocalSequence`, typed operation-specific payload union rejecting unknown fields); injected clock/ID creation boundary; fail-closed internal validators (explicitly NOT hostile-input parsers — Gate E); explicit lifecycle state machine (tombstone terminal, not forensic deletion); pure exhaustive reducer + deterministic replay (validate-all-then-apply, no partial state, no sort/dedupe/skip, complete replay starts at sequence 1); `InMemoryRoomOperationLog` (clone-on-append/read, unique IDs, contiguous sequences) + `NullRoomOperationLog` (retains nothing); **separate exactly-scoped decisions** for mutation vs log append/read/clear; 4 new matrix rows (107 specs → 749 rules; `room.project.snapshot` future-gated); guardrail determinism checks (`Date.now`/`Math.random`/`new Date` banned in replay modules, `JSON.stringify(event` banned shipped); 15 golden fixtures + deterministic sequence generators; 30 new tests (399 total); research + threat-model + precheck + boundary + audit docs. Gate H still deferred; no crypto/sync/identity; anti-spyware externalized. **Next: TECH-18 — RoomOS Object Model v1 + Policy-Gated Local Mutations**
- ✅ TECH-18 RoomOS Object Model v1 + Policy-Gated Local Mutations — exit criteria met (stacked on TECH-17): concrete local objects (message/note/task/decision/poll/file_ref) with explicit versioned schemas over a common envelope; plain-text-only content with UTF-8 byte limits + bounded arrays + NUL/surrogate/proto-pollution/getter defenses; an explicit **command union** (no generic `object.patch`/`set_property`/`merge_payload`/`json_patch`) validated fail-closed; local `revision` optimistic concurrency (create→1, +1 per mutation, stale/future/missing/overflow reject) — explicitly not distributed/causal/tamper-proof; deny-by-default policy-gated pipeline (`applyLocalRoomObjectMutationV1`) with **separate exact-scoped decisions** for mutation vs object-log append, Policy-Matrix cross-check, and logical all-or-nothing at the in-memory boundary; deterministic operation-specific events + pure reducer + memory/null object log + replay; explicit lifecycle/status machines (archived read-only, redaction one-way, tombstone terminal, not forensic erasure); file refs hold an opaque `localRefId` only (no bytes/path/URL); poll voting/tallies absent (Gate G/H); 12 new matrix rows (120 specs → 840 rules); `check:no-room-object-bypass` guardrail + fixture + CI; 33 new tests (432 total); research + threat-model + precheck + boundary + audit docs; Gate V + schema-evolution note. No transport/sync/CRDT/crypto/identity/AI/anti-spyware; not safe for real secrets. **Next: TECH-19 — RoomOS Privacy-Safe Local Query Model + Policy-Gated Views**
- ✅ TECH-19 RoomOS Privacy-Safe Local Query Model + Policy-Gated Views — exit criteria met (from merged TECH-18): a side-effect-free, policy-gated READ boundary (`packages/rooms/src/query/`) over an immutable, defensively-cloned snapshot — never the operation log. Query taxonomy (summary/list/detail/search/tasks/decisions/polls/file_refs/counts; unknown denies); privacy-safe view classes (summaries carry no content; content detail only where policy allows; requested view downgrade-only); exact-scope authorization (`room.query.summary/list/detail/search/count` — object IDs/actor refs confer no authority; list≠detail≠search≠count; mutation/storage cannot authorize a query); structured filters + deterministic sorting (object-ID tie-breaker; source never mutated); bounded local cursors (default 25/max 100/search 50; not authority, not persisted, content-free); exact case-sensitive in-memory search only (no index/history/cache/snippet/regex/fuzzy; term never logged; redacted/tombstoned never searched); counts off by default behind their own scope; strict-mode redaction (Ghost/Bunker/Emergency suppress actor refs/timestamps/revisions/counts; Bunker denies content+search); 11 new matrix rows (131 specs → 917 rules; semantic/remote/Bunker-content future-gated); `check:no-room-query-bypass` guardrail + fixture + CI; 28 new tests (460 total); research + threat-model + precheck + boundary + audit docs; Gate W. Side-effect-free (no event/log/storage/network/notification/AI/endpoint — trapped). No remote API/sync (Gate H), no encrypted index (Gate F), no identity (Gate G), no semantic search (Gate I); endpoint defense externalized (no capture protection); not safe for real secrets. **Next: TECH-20 — RoomOS Membership Model v1 + Local Capability Scaffolding**
- ✅ TECH-20 RoomOS Membership Model v1 + Local Capability Scaffolding — exit criteria met (from merged TECH-19): local, UNVERIFIED membership records (`packages/rooms/src/membership/`) held memory-only in `RoomMaterializedState`; placeholder roles (owner/editor/viewer/auditor) as ABAC attributes via an explicit role→capability eligibility table (role eligibility necessary, never sufficient); membership lifecycle machine (active↔suspended→removed_tombstone; tombstone terminal; duplicate/stale-revision reject); **last-owner continuity invariant** (last active owner cannot be removed/suspended/demoted); non-authoritative capability descriptors bound to room+membership+revision (`authoritative:false`, serialization/persistence forbidden, delegation not implemented, no wildcard) with attenuation (narrow-only; widening/subset-checked) + currency/staleness binding; `assertRoomAuthorizationContextV1` requires current membership + current descriptor + an **authentic exact-scope PolicyDecision** (descriptor never authorizes alone); membership mutation pipeline (separate mutation vs membership-log decisions; owner continuity; deterministic events + pure reducer + memory/null log); redacted membership queries (list/get/count, own scopes, no identity/presence/descriptor); local revocation (not distributed — Gate H); 18 new matrix rows (149 specs → 1043 rules; capability persist/serialize deny, delegate not_implemented, invite/identity_verify/distributed_revocation/endpoint_risk future-gated); `check:no-room-membership-bypass` guardrail + fixture + CI; 21 new tests (481 total); research + threat-model + precheck + boundary + audit docs; Gate X. No identity/invites/crypto/sync/distributed-revocation/endpoint-defense; device-risk placeholder tightens only, never identity assurance; not safe for real secrets. **Next: TECH-21 — RoomOS Membership Revocation + Authorization Regression Suite**
- ✅ TECH-21 RoomOS Membership Revocation + Authorization Regression Suite — exit criteria met (stacked on TECH-20): a centralized, fail-closed LOCAL authorization layer (`packages/rooms/src/authorization/`) proving membership/policy changes invalidate stale local authority before execution. `prepareRoomAuthorizationV1` binds a `RoomAuthorizationRevisionV1` fence (room + membership revision + local policy revision + lifecycle + privacy mode) + significant operation data into a non-authoritative, transient, non-serializable context; `assertPreparedRoomAuthorizationCurrentV1` is the FINAL execution-time gate re-checking the fence against CURRENT state + an authentic exact-scope `PolicyDecision` (a prepare is never sufficient; no auto-refresh). Suspension/removal/role-downgrade/reactivation + room-policy tightening + privacy-mode transitions (incl. less-restrictive) + lifecycle changes all invalidate prepared contexts; capability-SET role comparison (`compareRoleAuthorityV1`) + change-direction classifier; `applyLocalMembershipRevocationV1` enforces restrictive-direction (no escalation smuggling) + current-projection owner continuity with no partial effects; content-free `LocalAuthorizationInvalidationReportV1` (`current_local_projection_only`, `distributedRevocation:false`); a `policyRevision` field on `RoomMaterializedState` + deterministic fingerprint fallback; strict **no-authorization-cache** rule ([cache audit](audits/ROOM_AUTHORIZATION_CACHE_AUDIT.md)); 8 new matrix rows (157 specs → 1099 rules; cache/persist/serialize deny, endpoint-assurance deny, distributed/signed revocation future-gated); `check:no-room-authorization-bypass` guardrail + fixture + CI; 19 new tests (500 total); research + threat-model + precheck + boundary + cache + audit docs; Gate Y. Local only — no distributed/signed revocation, no identity, no authorization server, no single-use decisions (Gate B), no endpoint assurance; not safe for real secrets. **Next: TECH-22**

## Endpoint Defense / ScreenShield track (ADR-0012) — EXTERNALIZED

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The anti-spyware / Endpoint Defense / ScreenShield implementation has been split into a separate standalone project** (TECH-14 direction update). FreeLayer core keeps **policy hooks and compatibility contracts only** — ScreenShield levels as policy-tightening inputs, endpoint data classes/metadata events, matrix rows marked `future_gate`, docs/PBOM/Trust Center honesty. Once the standalone project is completed, it may be integrated through the dedicated **Endpoint Defense / Anti-spyware Integration Gate** ([IMPLEMENTATION_GATES.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GATES.md)) with its own ADR, threat model, PBOM update, and native-permission audit. The concept remains part of the product vision; only the *implementation location* changed. Enforcement: [audits/ANTISPYWARE_EXTERNALIZATION_AUDIT.md](audits/ANTISPYWARE_EXTERNALIZATION_AUDIT.md).

- ✅ RESEARCH-EDL-01 — Endpoint Defense + ScreenShield Research and Architecture (informs the external project; the research stays canonical here)
- ▸ TECH-EDL-02 … AUDIT-EDL-14 — **externalized** to the standalone anti-spyware project (ScreenShield policy schema, ProtectedContent contract, secure surfaces, clipboard/input firewalls, anti-overlay, device risk engine, capture-aware rooms, protected/sealed view, panic/decoy, canary/watermark, regression tests, audit). FreeLayer core tracks only the **integration gate**.

## Infrastructure track (separate from the technical phases)

The technical phase numbering above is unchanged by infrastructure work. Infra milestones:

- **Wiki refresh at first easy install** *(scheduled TODO)*: when an installable release exists (Phase 11 / Gate J), rewrite the wiki for end users — real installation steps in Getting-Started, fuller plain-language explanations on Home/FAQ — and publish via `pnpm wiki:publish`. Until then the wiki honestly says there is nothing to install.
- **Infra-01 — GitHub publication + live CI** *(this pass)*: public repository at <https://github.com/XGiammyX/freelayer>, README as a complete public landing page, GitHub Actions validated live, CI validation PR, security settings checklist ([GITHUB_SECURITY_SETTINGS.md](GITHUB_SECURITY_SETTINGS.md)), branch protection applied or documented ([GITHUB_REPOSITORY_SETUP.md](GITHUB_REPOSITORY_SETUP.md)), live results in [LIVE_CI_REPORT.md](LIVE_CI_REPORT.md). GitHub is the development platform only — never a runtime dependency.

## Cross-cutting rules

- Every phase: research → design → implementation → tests → audit.
- No phase may weaken a hard constraint to ship faster.
- THREAT_MODEL.md, PRIVACY_MODEL.md, and PBOM.md are re-reviewed at every phase boundary.

## Risks to this roadmap

- Crypto review (Phases 4–5) is the likeliest bottleneck — external review takes time and possibly funding.
- Serverless group messaging (Phase 6) has genuine unsolved-research flavor; scope may need cutting rather than corner-cutting.
- Solo/small-team bus factor; mitigated by documentation-first culture.

## TODO

- [ ] Attach issues/milestones to Phase 0–1 items once the repository is public
- [ ] Define "definition of done" checklists per phase in issue templates
- [ ] Revisit phase ordering after Phase 2 (policy engines may reshuffle storage vs. identity order)
